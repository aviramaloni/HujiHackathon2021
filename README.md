## General
### Overview
During the challenging period of Corona, many companies fell upon a realisation that would change the business world forever.
Companies were forced to pivot and move to a ‘work-from-home’ model.
Those who could not work from home were left behind.

### Understanding the Problem
| Problem 1  | Problem 2 | Problem 3 |
| ------------- | ------------- | - |
| Corona-invented need for a remote workspace. | Remote work and virtual meetings are likely to continue post the detrimental pandemic.  | Not every worker is able to create a sufficient ‘work-from-home’ stations.  |

McKinsey & Company studied more than 2,000 tasks used in some 800 occupations in the eight focus countries. Considering only remote work that can be done without a loss of productivity, they found that about 20 to 25 percent of the workforces in advanced economies could work from home between three and five days a week. This represents four to five times more remote work than before the pandemic and could prompt a large change in the geography of work, as individuals and companies shift out of large cities into suburbs and small cities.
