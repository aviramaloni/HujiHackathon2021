## General
### Overview
During the challenging period of Corona, many companies fell upon a realisation that would change the business world forever.
Companies were forced to pivot and move to a ‘work-from-home’ model.
Those who could not work from home were left behind.

### Understanding the Problem
| Problem 1  | Problem 2 | Problem 3 |
| ------------- | ------------- | - |
| Corona-invented need for a remote workspace. | Remote work and virtual meetings are likely to continue post the detrimental pandemic.  | Not every worker is able to create a sufficient ‘work-from-home’ stations.  |

McKinsey & Company studied more than 2,000 tasks used in some 800 occupations in the eight focus countries. Considering only remote work that can be done without a loss of productivity, they found that about 20 to 25 percent of the workforces in advanced economies could work from home between three and five days a week. This represents four to five times more remote work than before the pandemic and could prompt a large change in the geography of work, as individuals and companies shift out of large cities into suburbs and small cities.

### Project Objective
Software Development of *SitWithMe* application in order to provide access to public and private remote workspaces.

## Understanding the Market
### Trend Analysis
Coworking spaces have grown by over 1,000 percent over the span of a decade. Back in 2008, there were just 160 coworking spaces worldwide.
A decade later, there were 18,700 coworking spaces internationally. Within the next year and a half, coworking spaces are forecasted to reach 26,300 spaces worldwide.
- Built on buying and renting buildings.
- Turning them into shared office spaces.
- Renting out space and amenities for a subscription fee.
